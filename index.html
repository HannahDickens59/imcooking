            <p>To the best boyfriend out there, my one and only honey bun, sugar plum, give a dog a bone!</p>
            <br>
            <p>Here's to 175 200 480 seconds,</p>
            <br>
            <p>2 920 008 hours,</p>
            <br>
            <p>121 667 days,</p>
            <br>
            <p>Or, simply put, 4 months!</p>
            <br>
            <p>It has recently come to my attention that I have reached a point of no return. I am completely and utterly whipped (shocker). I am drawn to you in just about every possible way and there is no going back. Had I known the state I would be in, prior to these 4 months, I would not have believed it.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Because here I am, doing things that I never even imagined I'd be capable of doing. Like creating an entire web page, for the sole purpose of composing a silly little love letter on a random Wednesday afternoon.</p>
            <p>It's more like a mental illness now.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Q: WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO ME?</p>
            <br>
            <p>A: Unfortunately, that is a question that I might never be able to fully answer. All I know is one day we were strangers, and the next, we were laughing like we'd known each other forever.</p>
            <p>I love you so much my sweet boy! I've said it a hundred times before, but just in case you forgot ;) </p>
           <br>
            <p>Here's to many, many more beautiful months together <3.</p>
